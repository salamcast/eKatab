@Package eKatab

eKatab is a PHP interface to an ePub document to allow viewing of your created ibooks, ePub and zipped files with a 
META-INF/container.xml file pointing to an ofp doc.

It takes 2 arguments, the ePub file and the prefix to the ePub root in no standard zip file layout. 

Everything is done automatically once the classes is loaded.  

- access to your ebooks files with the URL path_info

- All links have been fixed on the fly

- bookmark-able links with REST-like design (GET only)
 
- even works with ePub files purchased from the iTunes book Store (as long as they're not encrypted)

- works with old o'really iPhone app books (.ipa file type), these will need to use the prefix. The ebook files are in 
  ePub format.  The prefix must contain a 'META-INF/container.xml' file or it will fail, ipa files are zips, not too 
  hard to figure out the prefix
  
- This is still a work in progress and hasn't really been touched in a few years, but it will display your ePub files 
  in a browser.

- The REST.class.php is still unpolished, it does the job for this package, but I plan in completing it in the future 
  when I get the time

- if you're an educational institution feel free to use and modify 

### Testing

This is a link to the site here, incase you want to check it out your self:

save the books to the root of this web app and the configuration will be generated for each book, that’s the default 
and easy way of using this program.
